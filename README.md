# CLIEngage LMS Development

This project provides development tools for working with the CLIEngage_LMS. It is designed to work best using Windows 10 with the Windows Subsystem for Linux version 2 (WSL2), Docker Containers, and VSCode. It is also designed to work with the LMS codebase restructured to use subtrees for shared modules rather than submodules.

QUICK START

- [Getting Started](./docs/getting_started.md) describes how to setup a development system on your PC that works with the tools and procedures defined here.
- [Development Procedures](./docs/procedures/overview.md) provides specific instructions for accomplished various development tasks. These procedures ensure proper management of the LMS codebase in its subtree form. These procedures depend on the setup and LMSTools defined above.

BACKGROUND

- [Docker Containers](./docs/docker.md) describes how Docker containers are used with this project.
- [LMS Structure](./docs/lms_structure.md) describes the organization of the codebase using Git subtrees.
- [LMSTools Powershell Module](./LMSTools/README.md) provides Powershell commands to support LMS development.
- [Project Structure](./docs/project_structure.md) describes how this project is organized.
